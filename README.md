# H0LiCOW public github repository

In this repository, users can find the posterior distributions of the time-delay distances and angular diameter distances for five of the six lens systems, in the directory "h0licow_distance_chains". The remaining lens (B1608+656) has an analytical fit to the PDF. 

If you make use of this data, please cite the relevant H0LiCOW publications:

The H0 inference from these distance posteriors can be obtained following our python notebook, under the direcory "H0_inference_code".  If you make use of the python notebook for H0 inference, please credit Martin Millon and Vivien Bonvin by citing this:

Our implementation of the 6-lens distance posteriors and sampling scripts in MontePython (Brinckmann & Lesgourgues 2019; Audren et al. 2013) can be found in the directory "". If you make use of this implementation, please credit Stefan Taubenberger and Sherry Suyu by citing this:
